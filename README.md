# Symbol-Provider-TS-Variables

Provides variables to `symbol-provider` on Tree-sitter grammars.

## TODO

  * Add query cache, to avoid having to recreate queries for any languages we have already done so for.
  * Validate `symbol` that's being returned to `symbol-provider`
  * Obviously support many more languages, shoot for at least the languages supported by Pulsar by default
  * Validate the method of finding tag files once package is properly installed
